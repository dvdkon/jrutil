# JrUtil

jrUtil is a library and command-line utility for working with Czech (and
Slovak) public transport data, such as:

- scheduled timetables (JDF to GTFS, CZPTTCIS to GTFS, more to come)
- real-time timetable changes (TODO)
- vehicle positions (TODO)

# Usage:

(This is outdated right now, sorry)

- Conversion of JDF timetables (found on [ftp.cisjr.cz](ftp://ftp.cisjr.cz/)) to
  GTFS. JrUtil takes a directory of JDF files and creates a directory representing a
  GTFS feed.

  Usage within the repo:

	dotnet run -- jdf_to_gtfs <JDF dir> <GTFS out dir>

- Conversion of CZPTTCISMessage XML files (found on
  [ftp.cisjr.cz](ftp://ftp.cisjr.cz/draha/celostatni/szdc)) to GTFS.

  Usage within the repo:

	dotnet run -- czptt_to_gtfs <XML input file> <GTFS out dir>

- Merging GTFS feeds.

  This currently probably only works for feeds generated by JrUtil. Merging
  any two feeds is extremely hard, and while it is a goal, it's not there yet.

  Usage from within the repo:

	dotnet run -- merge_gtfs <GTFS out dir> <GTFS in dir>...

For all these operations it's possible to use `-` as the input path and then
process multiple files at a time by piping their paths to stdin.
